            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Hi. I'm a motivated and adaptable Computer Science student with an interest in web development. A former Army combat medic and HR specialist who performs well under pressure, with strong people skills. I am enthusiastic about coding, technology and like coming up with solutions that solve problems. I am currently building projects that utilise my technical knowledge combined with creativity and am seeking opportunities to grow as a developer. The purpose of this website is to showcase myself and develop a website using nothing but HTML. The only CSS I have used has been to resize the images to maintain consistency and because some of them were dominating the pages they were on.</p>
