    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have a variety of hobbies and ways that I like to spend my time. I very often say yes to things, and like trying new activities.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading - I like reading all sorts of books, but my main genres are science fiction, philosophy, auto-biographies and fantasy</li>
        <li> Sports - I like to play badminton and tennis, and I am soon to start training for boxing for charity. I have also played on football and basketball teams in the past.</li>
        <li>Climbing - I enjoy climbing and have done it both indoor and outdoor. I tend to do bouldering more than climbing though.</li>
        <li>Travel - I love traveling. I have visited quite a few countries in Europe and South East Asia. I spent a year traveling SE Asia from 2019 - 2020</li>
        <li>Gaming - I enjoy gaming on occasion when I have spare time. My favourite genre of games at RPGs.</li>
    </ul>
